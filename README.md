This was a frontendmentor project. Had issues with the image and background image bit on the header. Had to refer to Coder Coder's tutorial to sort that out. The remaining part of the landing page was relatively easy. Used the GSAP librarry to add a bit of scroll animation.

This project is currently not optimized for desktop.
